## Project Description: 
- The goal of this project was to create a Memory Card Game, where the user clicks on images and has to make sure they don't click on the same image twice using their memory. Each time the user clicks an image, the images are shuffled. The project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum, and is one of my first web applications created using React. Furthermore, the goal was to learn how to use components, props, state, and hooks. 

## What I've learned:
- How to use functional components instead of class components with React.
- Learning how to use React Hooks, such as useState, to manage state in the components, and useEffect to manage lifecycle methods.
- More practice using state and props, including passing props to child components.
- Continued practice with updating state, and ensuring immutable methods of doing so.
- More practice using JSX to render elements.
- Structuring my application in a way that's maintainable and scalable.


## Final Thoughts:
This Memory Card Game project was really good practice using functional components and hooks. Overall, while the application/game is pretty simple, it gave me more experience and practice being comfortable coding in React. The biggest challenge for me was figuring out how to organize my application, and what sorts of components I wanted to create, to ensure that my application was maintainable and also easily scalable. In addition, figuring out which component would be a parent to any child components was important, to ensure that I could pass state as props, as needed. I definitely prefer the simplicity of using functional components over class components.
